## Existing Design, Planning, & Refined Design (Milestone 1)

### Existing Site: The Site (Milestone 1)
> What is your existing site about? Tell us about it.
My existing site is about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. Ithaca holds a annual Apple Festival, and my web site contains information about how to get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, some of the items that are sold at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, activities that you could do at the Apple Harvest Festival, buses to take in the Ithaca area to get to the festival, information about parking in the Ithaca area, and information about some of the local farmers that supports the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. My website is basically the information hub for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival for people who are planning on attending the Festival.

> How and where did you create this site?

I created this web site in INFO 1300, a course in which Professor Harms taught last semester. I created this site using the knowledge that I learned in INFO 1300. In creating the website, I first created a design for how I would like the website to be, and then I coded everything using HTML. After using HTML to code up the semantic meaning of the website, I then used CSS to style up my website.

> Is this site designed for desktop, mobile devices or both?

This website is designed for both desktop and mobile devices.


### Existing Site: Audience (Milestone 1)
> Who is your _existing_ site's audience?
> Briefly explain who the intended audience(s) is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site. Remember, you may not be the audience.

My site's intended audience are students who are planning on touring colleges in the Ithaca area with their family, because as the students are touring the Ithaca area, they can play their trip accordingly, so that they can also attend the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival to get a feel od what the Ithaca area is like. More specifically, my website's intended audience are students who are high school juniors or younger, because that is around the time when students typically start touring colleges and making decisions on where they might want to apply to in the future. My website will provide all of the information that the high school student and their family will need to make the most out of their time at the Festival. Helping high schoolers get a feel of the Ithaca area will also help them decide whether they would like to spend the next four years of their lives in the Ithaca area.

I think that my audience is appropriate because in the previous years, there has been time when the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival has been held on weekends. If the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival are held on weekends, more students and their families are likely to schedule tours to the Ithaca Area during that time, because most, if not all high school students do not have classes on the weekends. Also, most students of the high school juniors that I have spoke with from conducting User Research has voiced to me how much they wished that they could have had in person college tours, because they wanted to get a feel of what its like to be away from home. The families could get two birds with one stone in the sense that they could bring their kids to tour the schools in the Ithaca Area and they could also get a sense of what the Ithaca Area is like, through attending the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. Additionally, in a post-COVID world, the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival would allow families to get valuable outdoor bonding time.


### Existing Site: Audience Needs (Milestone 1)
> Document your existing site's audience's needs. (These should be informed by user research. Not assumptions.)
> List each need below. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> You may copy these from your previous project. However, I would encourage you to refine them.

Need/Want 1: Location
- **Needs and Wants** _What does your client and audience need and want?_
  - Needs to know how to get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those needs and wants?_
  - Include maps on my website. Also include a link to google maps that my users can easily click on.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - My users need to know how to get to the festival, because they can only partake in the festival if they are physically at the festival.


Need/Want 2: Purchases
- **Needs and Wants**
  - Need to know what they can buy at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include a list of images of the the items that my users can buy at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. Also include a caption to describe those images.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - My users need to know what they can buy at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, so that they calculate ahead of time the amount of money that they should bring

Need/Want 3: Parking
- **Needs and Wants**
  - Need to know about the parking rules in the Ithaca area

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include a small blurb about the parking rules in the Ithaca Area. Also include a link to the City of Ithaca Website, so that my users can get more information if they need.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - My users need to know about the parking rules in the greater Ithaca area because most/if not all of my intended users are coming from places where they are going to be driving to the Ithaca area, so it would be very helpful for them to know the details about parking in the greater Ithaca area

Need/Want 4: Latest News
- **Needs and Wants**
  - Need to be able to keep up with the latest information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include links to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, so that my users can be up to date with new information.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - My user need to know the latest information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, because in case the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival is getting canceled for any reason at all, it would be very helpful if they can get that information as soon as possible. They would not want to get to the festival and then realize that the festival is no longer going to be hosted.

Need/Want 5: Bus Service
- **Needs and Wants**
  - Need information about the T-CAT bus service

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include a link to the T-CAT bus service website, so my user can get the latest information that they need regarding the bus services

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - Some of my users may decided that they would like to take the bus to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival and that is why it is important for me to include information about the T-CAT bus service.

Need/Want 6: Activities
- **Needs and Wants**
  - Need to know about the activities that they can partake in at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include images and descriptions of activities that my users can partake in/watch at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - Users want to know the different activities that they can potentially participate in during the Festival, so they come prepared with what they would like to do in mind.

Need/Want 7: Contacts
- **Needs and Wants**
  - The user needs a way to easily contact the staff of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival in case they run into any trouble

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  I included a footer that include the contact information of the organizers of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - If the user runs into any trouble, they want to be able to reach those who are in charge of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival without going through too much hassle. The information is included a footer on every one of the web pages, so that no matter which page the user is one, they can more easily access the contact information for the organizers of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

Third Iteration of Card Sorting

![Fourth Iteration of Card Sorting](/documents/fourthIterationCardSort.jpg)
Fourth Iteration of Card Sorting

> Explain your thought process behind the card sorting. **Refer to the persona by name in your explanation.**

In my first iteration of card sorting, I decided that maybe I do not need a homepage, instead I will just make the about page the homepage. I made this decision in the first iteration of card sorting because I came to realize that since the about page contains the general information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, it could be the perfect replacement for the homepage. I was also thinking that by making the about page the homepage, every time a user gets onto my website, regardless if it is a first time user or not, they will be able to see the information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival First. I also had the navigation bar in the top row of the card sorting. In the second row, I placed the information regarding the maps and how to get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. In the third row is the about page. In the fourth row is where I placed the information regarding the products that will be sold at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. In the last row, I contained the feedback form. The item on the very left of each row is the name of its own webpage.

In my second iteration of Card sorting, I realized a flaw in the first iteration of the card sorting in the sense that if I made the about page my homepage, every time a user gets onto the website, they will see the general information regarding the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. I realized that returning users may not want to see this information over and over again, thus I have decided to bring back the home page. With the extra space in the about page, I decided to include more information about the farmers that are going to be vendors for the Festival, because the Festival would not be possible without the vendors. The about page also served as a page for the users to get more information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, and if my user wanted more information about the festival, they could use the links that I have provided on the about page to easily navigate to the different farmer's webpages and learn more about the festival. If my user wanted to support the local farmers, they could also use the about page to easily find out more about the farmers that they would like to support. Another reason why I realized that bringing back the homepage is important is because I realized that when users first get onto my website, they would like to know about the current events of the festival, so I decided to meet the needs of my users by populating the homepage with up to date relevant information, such as the weather and performances/activities that may occur on the day of the festival.

In my third iteration of Card sorting, I added more of the pieces that I am going to be including on the navigation web page. The user needs to know about the parking and bus service in the Ithaca area, thus they need links to pages where they can get that information. I included links to both the Ithaca parking site and to the T-CAT bus service site. For my feedback page, I also added pieces of information that the form is going to ask the user, in order to better help the user provide compliment/complaint about their experience at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

In my fourth iteration of Card sorting, I added a contact footer to my previous card sorting on every single one of my web pages. I added this footer, because I realized that my users needed a way to easily access the contact information for the organizers of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, so if any problem were to occur, they won't have to look all over the place to try to find help. Additionally, the contact footer also serves as a partial.


> Lastly, list the pages that resulted from your final card sort (i.e. your site's navigation) and content for each page.

### Refined Site: Design (Milestone 1)
> Refine the design of your site to meet the needs of your users using your persona.
> Include sketches of each page of the refined design.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.
> Document your _entire_ design process. **Show your preliminary sketches and your final sketches.** **We want to see iteration!**
> Don't forget the form and confirmation page!
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**

![Image of first draft of Home page](/documents/dHome.jpg)
Image of first draft of Home page - I was think that maybe all of the content should be centered for the users

![Image of final for Home page](/documents/fHome.jpg)
Image of final for Home page - I realized that if the content are divided up into an aside element and a main element, the space of the web page is better utilized in the sense that there is less white space

![Image of first draft of About page](/documents/dAbout.jpg)
Image of first draft of About page - I think that the general information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival should be centered so that it is the first and only think that people see when they get onto this web page

![Image of final for About page](/documents/fAbout.jpg)
Image of final for About page - I realized that if the general information is in the center of the web page, the user is going to need to scroll down the page to find the information regarding the vendors that are apart of the festival, which sometimes the users might miss. Additionally, The image in the center of the web page creates a lot of white space, so I have decided yet again to split up the content into a aside element and a main element.

![Image of first draft of Navigation page](/documents/dNavigation.jpg)
Image of first draft of Navigation page - At first I thought that the main purpose of this web page is to contain the links to google maps, the Ithaca Parking lot page, and the T-CAT bus services page. This is the reason why I had the links up top, which including the three images of maps for the festival on the bottom.

![Image of final for Navigation page](/documents/fNavigation.jpg)
Image of final for Navigation page - After giving my original though a careful examination, I came to realize that from Joseph's perspective, it would be much better to also separate the contents into an aside element and main element, because he is going to be needing the maps when he arrives at the festival and it would be a hassle for Joseph, if I kept the maps below all of the links.

![Image of final for Products page](/documents/dProducts.jpg)
Image of first draft for Products page - My initial thought is to have 4 images per row, so that the users will not have to keep scrolling in order to view all of the images of the products that are going to be available at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

![Image of final for Products page](/documents/fProducts.jpg)
Image of final for Products page - After my initial thought, I came to realize all of the images are in different shapes and sizes. From INFO 1300, Professor Harms taught us the importance of alignment, thus I have decided to only have 2 images per row on my web page so that all of the images are aligned to the best possible layout. Professor Harms taught us that it will be a usability issue if the user keeps having to move their eyes all over the webpage in order to view the images. With the images close and centered, the user will not have to move their eyes all over the place to view the images.

![Image of final for Feedback page](/documents/dFeedback.jpg)
Image of first draft for Feedback page - My initial idea about the feedback form is to align everything to the left, because I have seen feedback forms aligned like this in many places on the internet.

![Image of final for Feedback page](/documents/fFeedback.jpg)
Image of final for Feedback page - After thinking carefully about what Professor Harms talked about in INFO 1300, I realized that it is not a good idea to be aligning the forms to the left side of the page, because there is a lot of white noise, and the labels and controls are not properly aligned, so I changed the layout so that the form is aligned in the center.

### Partial Plan (Milestone 1)
> Using your refined sketches, plan your site's partials.
> You may describe each partial or sketch it. It's up to you!

In my refined sketches, I can see that the two partials that I am going to be implementing are for my header and for my footer. My header contains my navigation bar, which I use consistently throughout all of my web pages. My footer contains the contact information for the organizers of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival event so that if any of my users every run into any problem at all, they can easily find the information about how they can get help. They can call the given phone number or they can send an email to the address that is listed in the footer.

In my final sketches for each web page, I included the sketch for the footer and header. The footer is at the bottom of each page and contains the contact information for the organizers of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. The header is at the top of each page and it contains the navigation bar and the logo for the website. I utilized many div in my header to be able to display my navigation bar properly, but in general when I refer to my header, I mean the entire navigation bar, which includes the logo of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, the welcome message, and the different links to the different web pages.

The customization the partials will be done in the header. This is because depending on the different web page that the user is one, the navigation bar needs to reflect the web page that the user is on or else the user would not be able to tell which web page they are on. The footer contains the same information across all of the web pages, so there is no need to customize the footer.

## Sticky Form (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?
- Text field (This is for the name and email component of the form)
- Number field (This is going to be for the number of attendees part of the form)
- Text area (This is for the experience component of the form, so that the user could write in a couple of sentences about their experience)
- Dropdown list (This is for the component where the user choose how they arrive at the festival)
- Checkboxes (This is for the component where the user chooses the activities that they partook in during the festival)


> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.
> Use your persona. Refer to the persona by name. Explain how the feedback messages are usable for your persona.

![Image of the feedback messages for Feed form](/documents/error-messages_feedback_form.jpg)
The feedback messages are usable for Joseph Johnson because it does not blame Joseph for entering in the wrong input into the given fields. Instead, the feedback just suggest to Joseph which fields he has inputted incorrectly and how he can go about correcting the invalid inputs. Additionally, the placements of the feedback messages are very indicative of which fields that Joseph filled in with invalid input. The feedback messages are place right above the label component of the field and this good because Joseph will know which fields he needs to change the inputs for. In INFO 1300, Professor Harms taught us that we can't solely rely on color to let the users know that a feedback message has appeared, so in addition to changing the color of the feedback messages to red, I also added a line(border) on the left of the feedback message to indicate to Joseph that a feedback message has appeared.

> How does this form meet the needs of your persona?
> Refer to the persona by name.

This form meets the needs of Joseph, because Joseph wants a place where he can complain/compliment the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, in hopes of making the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival better the next year. This form contains fields that asks for Joseph's name and email. The field for name allows the organizers of the event to properly address Joseph when they are emailing him to followup with the complaint/compliment that he made in this feedback form. Joseph may feel like he has a lot of new suggestions that he needs to get off of his chest, and thus he can write in the experience text area that he would like the event organizers to email or call him so that he can get everything off of his chest. The importance of the experience text area is that Joseph can express any of the emotions that he felt during the festival and why he felt those emotions. This feedback is very vital to improve future festivals. Joseph wants to make this festival better and through filling out the mode of transportation and number of attendees that he came to the festival with, Joseph can provide information about whether the festival should include more events geared towards families or not, and whether the event should ask the local government for a parking lot permit so more families can easily park their cars. Joseph also needs a place where he can fill out events that he would like to see in future Ithaca Apple Harvest Festivals, and it is through using the checkboxes that Joseph can select the events that he attended. The organizers of this event will use this form to access which event(s) is most popular, to determine which event(s) should be brought back to future festivals.


### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write out your pseudocode plan for handling the validation of the form.

```
When the user submits the form:
  If the name component data is valid:
    Hide the name feedback message
  else:
    Show the name feedback message (Please enter your full name)
  If the email component data is valid:
    Hide the email feedback message
  else:
    Show the email feedback message (Please enter your email address)
  If primary mode of transportation component data is valid:
    Hide the primary mode of transportation feedback message
  else:
    Show the primary mode of transportation feedback message (Please select how you arrived at the festival)
  If the attendee component data is valid:
    Hide the attendee feedback message
  else:
    Show the attendee feedback message (Please select the number of visitors (including yourself))
  If the experience component data is valid:
    Hide the activities feedback message
  else:
    Show the experience feedback message (Please share your experiences at the festival today)
  If the activities feedback component data is valid:
    Hide the activities feedback message
  else:
    Show the activities feedback message (Please select the activities that you participated in)
  If the form data is valid (all of the components have valid inputs/no error messages):
    Send data(all of the inputs) to the server
  else:
    Do not submit the form/send the form to the server

```

### Audience (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the audience. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable for your persona. Refer to the persona by name.

Joseph wants to avoid getting sun burns, and I have met this need by including the link to the weather channel's website, so that he can check the weather accordingly before attending to the festival. The information about the weather allows Joseph to dress accordingly so that he can avoid getting sun burns. Joseph also has a lot of time to explore the Ithaca area, and that is why I included the link on the main page to other activities that he can do while he is in Ithaca. Since Joseph has a lot of time on his hands, he will need other activities to keep him occupied before the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival opens up to the general public, the list of activities that the Visit Ithaca Homepage provides will meet this need of his. Joseph is also traveling with his parents, so the list of activities provided by the Visit Ithaca Homepage will also provide a lot of family bonding time for Joseph and his family. On my home page, I included links to the social media pages of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival so that Joseph will be up to date with the latest news regarding the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. On my maps page, I included a link to google maps that contains the preset destination of area where the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival will take place and this will allow Joseph and his family to easily get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. I also included maps on the webpage that would help Joseph and his family navigate around the Ithaca Apple Harvest festival. Joseph's family is coming to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival by car and they need to know the information about parking in the greater Ithaca Area, and I met this need by including on my navigation page a little bit of information regarding the prices to park in the City of Ithaca. I also included a link to the City of Ithaca website, so that in case Joseph's family need more information, it is readily available. Joseph and his family is also planning on taking the bus to get around Ithaca to explore, so I have also included a link to the TCAT website. Joseph and his family wants to know what they could purchase at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, so they could roughly gauge the amount of money that they might need, and I met this need of their by including a list of items that can be bought at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. I also placed a note at the top of the page saying that the prices of the items have yet to be determined. Using the weather Channel, Joseph can also determine around what time the sun will set and this is important because Joseph and his family want to get home before it gets dark. My homepage also includes a list of potential activities that is going to be occurring during the festival and this is important because this way Joseph can plan which events he want to partake in at the festival. Lastly, Joseph wants to have a place where he can complain/compliment about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, and this is where the feedback form comes in. Joseph will be able to voice his concerns and/or what he liked about the festival.

### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?

One of the many things is that I learned the importance of having a form confirmation page. The confirmation page give the user confidence that they have filled out the form correctly, and this makes our form more usable, because the user will not have to question whether or not they have successfully submitted their form. I also learned the importance of having server side rendering, because malicious users are able to easily bypass client side render, and this could be a huge security concern for both our database and the information that is on our database. Using partials was another thing that I learned during this assignment. Using partials allow us to reduce the amount of redundant code that we write, and this also makes debugging easier. Another big takeaway that I had from this assignment is using the persona. Creating Joseph from user research and using Joseph throughout this entire assignment allowed me to really focus in on the needs of Joseph, my users. Making sticky forms was yet another thing that I learned during this assignment. Professor Harms taught us that not having a sticky form poses a huge usability issue, because users have to re-enter every piece of information every time they submit a form with invaild input, and this can get very annoying. From personal experience, I also remember how frustrated every time I get when I encounter forms that are not sticky. I have improved from 1300, because I can now do things that I have not been able to do in INFO 1300. One of such example is the ability to not make hidden things appear in the source code. Through the use of php, I can now completely hide parts or whole pages that I do not want my user to see. This makes my web site more usable because if one of my user uses a screen reader to access my web site, then the screen reader would not read out the part of my page that is just "hidden," because now I have completely prevented the html from showing up in the source page when certain conditions are not met. One trouble that I had when implementing my web site was when I was making my form sticky. This is because I used a textarea and a dropdown list in my form, and we did not learn how to make these input control sticky, so I had to try to use what I have learned from Professor Harms and some of the ideas in the course textbook to figure this out. In the end, through the trial and error with my code, I was able to get these form controls to be sticky.

- includes/header.php: I included this on every page, because every page needs a header, which contains the navigation bar
- includes/footer.php: I included this on every page, because the footer contains the contact information to the Staff of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival


> Which partials have customization? Explain how the customization looks in the browser.

- header.php shows a border around the current page
The Requirements states that one partial must demonstrate customization and I used customization in my header.php. In the browser, the web page that is currently active will have a purple colored border that surrounds it. This is taking place in the navigation bar, which is at the top of my web site.
