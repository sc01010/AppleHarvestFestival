      <h3 class= "decrease-margin">About the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival</h3>
      <p class= "normal-description"> The Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival is an annual event that occurs in Ithaca. This year is supposed to be the 38th anniversary of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, but because of the Global Pandemic, this event came to a halt this year. Typically there are also performers at this festival where attendees get to watch all sorts of live performances. There is also a Apple Festive Trail that attendees could follow to enjoy an experience that we have tailored ahead of time.

      <h3 class= "decrease-margin">About the Local Farmers</h3>
      <p class= "normal-description spacing-description"> The Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival is a open air farmers market and we would really appreciate everyone for attending and supporting the local Ithaca Farmers. Our goal is to serve and give back to this community. Please go back to the home page to visit some of our vender's websites to get to know each and one of them better. Thank you all very much for your patronage.</p>
